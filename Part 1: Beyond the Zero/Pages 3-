"Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. 
Everything science has taught me, and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief
in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death"

Page 3: "A screaming comes across the sky. It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now"
    - Iconic opening to a novel

Page 3: "...he sits in velveteen darkness..."
    - Love the imagery Pynchon is illustrating here, all to describe a man sitting on a train

Page 3: "He's afraid of the way the glass will fall-soon-it will be a specatcle: the fall of a crystal palace"

Pages 3-4: "No, this is not a disentanglement from, but a progressive knotting into..."
    - As they move along inside this carriage, things are only looking worse outside

Page 5: "There is no way out. Lie and wait, lie still and be quiet. Screaming holds across the sky. When it comes, will it come in darkness,
or will it bring its own light? Will the light come before or after?"
    - Terrifying way to describe a scenario of a rocket on its way to bring death

    The novel begins with an unnamed man at a train station that has been devasted from war/shelling. The area is dark and dangerous.
The man is afraid of the glass overhead falling unto him. Inside the train car, there is an assortment of characters, none of whom are speaking.
They begin to leave the station, heading deeper into the city (is this the way out?). As they trudge along, the surrounding area is even
more annihilated than where they came from. Again, the imagery Pynchon paints here is so vivid. There is reflections on what the city used to be
before it became a wasteland, and the more they travel along, the more clastrophobic it all feels, until finally they come to a screeching halt.

    They ("Evacuees") are ushered off of the train by nameless, uniformed men. They have arrived at a decrepid hotel where they are herded onto 
elevators where they are offloaded and stuffed into invisible rooms. All the people are hearing a voice, almost mockingly, ask them if they
really expected to be saved. They are trapped. Pynchon tell the reader that "it" (V-2 Rocket) will be coming for them.
