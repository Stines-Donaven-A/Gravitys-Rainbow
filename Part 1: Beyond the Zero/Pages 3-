"Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. 
Everything science has taught me, and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief
in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death"
    - Wernher Von Braun

    The novel begins with an unnamed man at a train station that has been devasted from war/shelling. The area is dark and dangerous.
The man is afraid of the glass overhead falling unto him. Inside the train car, there is an assortment of characters, none of whom are speaking.
They begin to leave the station, heading deeper into the city (is this the way out?). As they trudge along, the surrounding area is even
more annihilated than where they came from. Again, the imagery Pynchon paints here is so vivid. There is reflections on what the city used to be
before it became a wasteland, and the more they travel along, the more clastrophobic it all feels, until finally they come to a screeching halt.

    They ("Evacuees") are ushered off of the train by nameless, uniformed men. They have arrived at a decrepid hotel where they are herded onto 
elevators where they are offloaded and stuffed into invisible rooms. All the people are hearing a voice, almost mockingly, ask them if they
really expected to be saved. They are trapped. Pynchon tells the reader that "it" (V-2 Rocket) will be coming for them. Our character is waking 
from a dream, in a room filled with decrepid people.

    His name is Captain Geoffrey "Pirate" Prentice. Above him, Teddy Bloat is on a crumbling balcony, unaware that the only thing holding him
there is a rip by his hip pocket that has gotten snagged. As Bloat is rolling around in his sleep he falls off the balcony and Pirate, 
seeing this kicks his bed underneath him to break his fall. Bloat is hardly fazed, and goes back to sleep on the new bed. Pynchon then tells us
that Bloat is the co-tenant to the duplex they're living in. The duplex is located in central London and was built by Corydon Throsp, who is
friendly with the Rosettis. The Rosettis have a garden on top of the roof that can grow just about anything due to its rich topsoil. The topsoil
is a mix of manure from 3 prize pigs, dead leaves from decorative trees, and meals thrown up by the "sensitive epicurean". 

    On this rooftop garden, Pilot is growing bananas that he is very fond of and the residents are obsessed with the breakfasts he provides from
them. After taking a piss, Pilot throws on a robe and makes his way to the rooftop. The air outside is crisp and bitter as he overlooks the city
from the parapet. Off on the horizon he witnesses a rocket launch (V-2). "Incoming Mail" he says to himself. He is debating what he should do as 
he sees the rocket dissapear into the atmosphere. 5 Minutes..
